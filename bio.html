      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a BA Studio Practice Prep for Teaching major with a Minor in Ceramic Art. I have studied at Modesto Junior College and have received an Associates Degree in Studio Art in 2020. I attend San Jose State University, where I am studying to pursue a BFA Pictorial Art degree and a career in Teaching. I enjoy creating and helping others, and is the reason why I want to make a career out of the one thing that I love doing.
      <br><br>
        Art is a passion of mine that has always been a place for me to relax and be myself. Art has also helped me with my health as well. Having high anxiety, that leads to many anxiety attacks, keeps me from enjoying the many things in my life with friends or family. Art has been my own personal form of therapy to help understand what triggers my anxiety, and helps to relax myself in stressful situations. While working on my own artworks, it has been a great platform to challenge myself in doing something that is out of my comfort zone, or dig deeper into what it is I am creating. Over the past several years, my artistic development has led me into the fascination of memory loss. While losing the loved ones in my life and becoming older everyday, my poor memory has affected my everyday life. Many of my artworks have been a platform in addressing my internal struggle of capturing memories that I have no recollection of, or do not want to lose in my life.
