      “You have to begin to lose your memory, if only bits and pieces, to realize that memory is what makes our lives. Life without memory is no life at all…Without it, we are nothing.”

-Luis Bunuel
        <br><br>
        As we grow older, our minds age along with our body and destroys what is held within. As I am growing older, I am experiencing this loss of memory and has become my biggest fear. I am at the age where the loved ones in my life have passed on, and my only connection to them is the photographic evidence and the memories I have. During this Covid-19 pandemic, my family has taken upon themselves to revisit those photographs and was then that I had confronted my fear. Gazing upon those images and searching my mind for the memory that never came felt mentally violated. That my body had naturally disposed of my memory without my consent. That my subconscious had stolen my identity and had given consent to relieve my body of this burden.     
      <br><br>
        In order to confront these fears or to learn more about myself, I channel my exploration through painting. This painting is a representation of the mental abuse that my subconscious forces upon my mind. These subconscious hands, that comes from the void of my mind, holds me down and forces this destruction into my body. That I have been rendered submissive in the fight, and my subconscious has controlled my movement and consumption. While forcing this once symbolized object of preserving memory, has been cleansed in hell fire and become an object of destruction. Leaving my body defenseless to consume the poisonous smoke and destroy the memory that is held within the void of my mind. No matter how hard I fight against this act, I will ultimately lose in the end.
