      <p>
      This is my Glitch project that was made in my Fall 2021 Digital Media Arts class.
        <br><br>
        For this glitch art assignment I had decided to focus my glitched images around the theme of Figure in a Landscape. I had pulled images I had taken during my years in high school when taking little trips through the academic year. These glitched images where a perfect blend between nature, man, and technology. During the process of glitching my images, I had ran into a problem in viewing my images and made the process frustrating rather than enjoyable. Through trial and error of using different applications and devices, I had found that viewing my image through photoshop was the way to go in viewing the outcome of my glitched work. The process I chose in glitching my images was to glitch the original image several times, and going back into each result and pushing the glitch more and more. I had focused on copying code from one result into the newly glitched image and continuing the simple removing and adding code within the text. Overall, this assignment was frustrating to work with but through trail and error came to enjoy the process in creating A Serene Walk.
